# Quiz_Game_OOPs

Classes and objects (5 classes has been created)
Multi-level Inheritance (In class student, teacher and admin)
Encapsulation (binding data members and member functions in a single class)
Abstraction (Displaying only the required details) and Data Hiding For example, showing student details only to teacher and admin, and displaying teacher details only to the admin.
Inline functions – The functions viewStudentDetails() and viewTeacherDetails() are inline functions in the program
Default constructors and Parameterized constructors – In class date, parameterized constructor is used to display day. In class student, default constructor is used to set the variable score to zero.
Polymorphism: In this program, compile-time polymorphism has been used. We have used Function overloading in class date. The functions are: void print(int) and void print(string)
Virtual function – In class teacher, void viewTeacherDetails() has been declared as zero. This is called Pure Virtual Function. Hence, the class teacher can be called as an Abstract Class.
Friend Class – The class Quiz is a friend class of class student.
Passing Object as an Argument – In function stu_details, an object of class student is passes as an argument to the function QuizQues(), which is in class Quiz.
Using ctime header file – This enables us to set a time limit, here, 50 seconds. If the student exceed 50 seconds, then 5 marks will be deducted.
