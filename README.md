->Classes and objects (5 classes has been created)<br />
->Multi-level Inheritance (In class student, teacher and admin)<br />
->Encapsulation (binding data members and member functions in a single class)<br />
->Abstraction (Displaying only the required details) and Data Hiding For example, showing student details only to teacher and admin, and displaying teacher details only to 
  the admin.<br />
->Inline functions – The functions viewStudentDetails() and viewTeacherDetails() are inline functions in the program<br />
->Default constructors and Parameterized constructors – In class date, parameterized constructor is used to display day. In class student, default constructor is used to set   the variable score to zero.<br />
->Polymorphism: In this program, compile-time polymorphism has been used. We have used Function overloading in class date. The functions are: void print(int) and void       
  print(string)<br />
->Virtual function – In class teacher, void viewTeacherDetails() has been declared as zero. This is called Pure Virtual Function. Hence, the class teacher can be called as     an Abstract Class.<br />
->Friend Class – The class Quiz is a friend class of class student.<br />
->Passing Object as an Argument – In function stu_details, an object of class student is passes as an argument to the function QuizQues(), which is in class Quiz.<br />
->Using ctime header file – This enables us to set a time limit, here, 50 seconds. If the student exceed 50 seconds, then 5 marks will be deducted.<br />
